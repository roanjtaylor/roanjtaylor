# About me

- 🔭 I’m currently working on a football-related startup, and a safety-related contact app.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about my past, to optimise my present and make the most of the rest of my life.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I dislike computer work as I am stationary and looking at a lit screen, but I love building cool, meaningful things... the game's the game.
- 🍕 Massive fan of all good food- open to suggestions.
- ⛰️ Until this point in my life has been entirely gathering data and testing various strategies and ways of life. I have relaxed, worked, played, and thought loads. Now I am confident to take my full control of my life, setting clear goals to achieve. My mindset understands life as a mountain range because it simplifies situations in my head so that I understant the best way solve issues.
- 🧑‍🏫 As Prof. Keating says, "Carpe diem!"
